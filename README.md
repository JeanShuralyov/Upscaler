# Upscaler
[![Holloway's Upscaler](artworks/logo-1200x630.svg)](https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/Upscaler)
This project is a combination of various open-source AI image upscaling project
efforts for making a CLI friendly image upscaler program that are interactable
with FFMPEG and GIMP. Among the main contributors are:

1. [Tencent's NCNN](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn)
2. [Nihui](https://github.com/nihui)
3. [Xintao](https://github.com/xinntao)
4. [Upscayl (Nayam Amarshe & TGS963)](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/tree/main)




## Why It Matters
For these obvious reasons:

1. **To consolidate a list of tested and reusable models and executables** -
   quick deployment at usable CLI level for further integration.
2. **Determine use cases** - need to ensure what is needed and what's not.
3. **Map out the required APIs and calls** - before writing and compiling a big
   binary.
